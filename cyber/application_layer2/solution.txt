Exercise 1:
-generate ssh rsa key:
	ssh-keygen -t rsa

-copy private key to server:
	ssh-copy-id -i /path/to/ssh/key <server_user>@<server_ip>
	
-configure server /etc/ssh/sshd_config to require both password and key:
	AuthenticationMethods "publickey,password"
	#PasswordAuthentication yes
	
-disable password authentication :
	AuthenticationMethods "publickey"
	#PasswordAuthentication no
	
-copy from remote using scp:
	scp <server_user>@<server_ip>:/path/to/copy/file /path/to/save/location
	
	
Exercise 2:
-download the source code for openssh

-modify int mm_answer_authpassword function in monitor.c:
	passwd variable is the incoming password in cleartext have fun with it

-build the sshd executable:
	./configure --with-md5-password --with-pam --sysconfdir=/etc/ssh
	make
	sudo make install

-replace the old sshd with the new one we made ;)

-restart the machine / stop and start the service (cause for some reason it wont let me restart the service while running sometimes)
